## Guide to Navigating and Editing the "DHR Follow-up" Excel Spreadsheet

### The Structure:
As we all know, each catalog number folder comprises batches, and each batch contains one of - 
1. QCS and RIR.
2. Route card and WI. 

The spreadsheet consists of sheets (not something critical to you, it was split for my convenience). 
In each sheet, each row represents a batch for a catalog number, while each column represents a gap in one of - 
1. Either QCS or RIR. 
2. Either route card or WI.

There are two blue columns indicating who is responsible for the one of -
1. QCS part and the RIR part, respectively.
2. Route card part and the WI part, respectively.

#### Your Task:
Use the Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) function to find your name, one of - {Merav, Vadim, Ariella, Gayane, Jonathan, Nir, Ido}. 
You will either find it under the title "Signature", which means you need to sign the file, or inside one of the blue columns, indicating your responsibility for completing or explaining at least half of the row (either the QCS part or the RIR part OR either the route card part or the WI part).

#### Completing the Task:
Each cell that is not empty in the row represents a problem, briefly explained. 
After understanding the problem, proceed to fix or explain it. Once fixed or explained, mark the cell with a yellow background to indicate completion. 
If you finish the entire part you're responsible for, mark with a yellow background your name in the respective blue column.
##### How to fix? 
Solve the specific problem and make a line on the error, sign near it, and put the current date.

##### How to explain? 
With a "Review"->"new comment" while you are on the specific cell.

### Special Instructions:
- If you see a gray marked cell, I already took care of it.
- In QCS parts, there are date and effective date columns.
  - If written that the dates are missing, you need to complete them. 
  - If you see the structure: "XX<YY" - ignore it (and leave it as is) - Jonathan and I are taking care of it (will do a CAPA).
- In RIR parts, there is a sample size column. Ignore it (and leave it as is) - Jonathan and I are taking care of it (will do a CAPA).
- There are checks that already done - (for example: "e+f+g attributes needs to be 100% inspection" but you did less) - 
  we cannot edit it - leave it as is, Jonathan and I are taking care of it (will do a CAPA).
- The documents should be signed the day the inspection was conducted.
  - If the inspector did not specify the date, please put the delivery date (×ª×¢×•×“×ª ×ž×©×œ×•×—).
  - If you have none, sign it with todayâ€™s date but be sure that you write in that cell a comment: "Current date",  it will be addressed specifically as part of the CAPA we need to produce.
- On a situation that requires the signature of someone who no longer works at Coramaze - Ido will sign + NO CAPA needed.
- On a situation where a batch folder/specific RIR/specific QCS does not exist - CAPA will be done, please ignore it.
- On a situation where there is a supplier on an RIR that isn't mentioned on the relevant QCS suppliers list -  
  Update the QCS (new revision) + put a comment on that cell + Jonathan and I will do a CAPA.
- Please be aware that one QCS can be related to many batches, so sometimes fixing one QCS will be fixing many lines on the Excel sheet -
  you can see which QCS is relevant to a batch on the specific RIR.
- If you add text to a specific cell (and not by a command), please write it with red color.
- If it is something that you do not know if you can change - please ask.

PLEASE - don't delete the content of any cell.
